The Chinese Mountain Yam is a tuber found across northern Asia that tastes a bit like radish when raw, Its most defining feature is certainly its texture, which becomes sticky and slimy the more it's handled or cut. For the Japanese and Chinese, that's the draw, though it can also be cooked in soups and stews, where the slimy texture acts as a natural thickener. Try them in this simple and refreshing Chinese Mountain Yam Stir-Fry recipe!

& 



The yam must be soaked in water and vinegar prior to use to neutralize any potential irritation. Use a potato peeler to peel off the Chinese yam skin, remember to wear gloves when handling fresh Chinese yam as it will cause your hands to itch.

Barret maintains yields at very low levels which not only alleviates disease pressure but has the added benefit of increasing intensity in the wines. Long slow ferments using only indigenous yeasts and no filtration or fining result in wines that are a true expression of their terroir.

¡°Barret represents the future in Cornas. His domaine is, in my opinion, the single most exciting new domaine in the appellation today. With his nearly 14 hectares of vines (11 in Cornas), Barret is producing a quartet of wines that represent a new paradigm for Cornas?vivid, exceptionally bright, racy fruit flavors that at the same time harness the taut, sometimes severe minerality of the Syrah grown on the east- and southeast-facing granite slopes above the town.¡± James Molesworth of Wine Spectator March ¡®09

In French the words 'Sans Soufre Ajout¨¦' means no added sulphur. This wine has not had sulphur added to the bottle. The only sulphur in it is naturally occurring sulphur which is in minuscule quantities. The wine has traveled well to Australia and displays a liveliness and freshness that is typical of naturally-made wines that have not had sulphur added. The 2010 vintage is a particularly fine example of this blended wine. This vintage sees Grenache Blanc, Rolle (the local name for Vermentino), Roussane, Chardonnay and Muscat Petit Grains used in the blend. The wine was kept on lees in old barriques for 5 months. This is a beautiful wine that is fresh and lively now but will continue to change character and improve well into the future. No filtration or fining has been applied to this wine. This is a great wine for people who have developed a reaction to sulphur.
